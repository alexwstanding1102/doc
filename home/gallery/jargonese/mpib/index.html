  <p class="sp">> what has changed since the early attempts at human characters vs what i make now??</p>
  <p>2:23 PM July 26th, 2024</p>
  <p style="line-height: 1.75">> when i first started using blender, i was trying to make meshes to use in my roblox games all the way back in late september of 2022! it would be a year before i started to attempt to create
   actual human(or somewhat human) characters with the program.
  </p><br>
  <p style="line-height: 1.75">> 
    i started out with my characters having unrealistic skin tones, such as red, grey, etc. as i felt that i still couldn't get a grasp on how to make characters not uncanny. my first attempt at a human character had red skin
     with disconnected parts for joints. i didn't know how armatures and rigging worked in blender, so i simply made each body part separate and rigged it in Roblox of all things. the method used was the good old(BAD old) skin+subdiv method.
     it gave me dubious results...just take a look.

  <p style="line-height: 1.75">> that's pretty bad!! i didn't use reference sheets or any type of method to make accurate anatomy, but this was the best i could do at the time...</p>
  <p style="line-height: 1.75">> jumping over to february of this year, i honestly think that this is even worse. for this second attempt, there's grey skin and even crappier anatomy. look at this.</p>

  > that's really bad. i showed this to my friends like "look at what i made" and i understand why they left me now

  > in may, i decided to try again. i think it's kinda good, but cloth simulation is a pain in the ass, and i dont think blender gives a sh*t because they haven't fixed their god damn physics simulation. that doesn't really matter though, just have a look!!
