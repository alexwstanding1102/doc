  <p class="sp">> comparison between Blender rendering engines Eevee and Cycles!!</p>
  <p style="line-height: 1.75">> hello!! this post is mostly gonna just be comparisons between results in eevee and cycles, with some details and explanations of which one's better at doing certain things.</p><br>
  <p style="line-height: 1.75">> while cycles yields [subjectively] better results, with more features like anistropic materials, ray traced light sources, actual reflections of other objects in the scene, etc., eevee has the upper hand in one sector of the rendering game: speed. eevee is quite a lot faster
  than cycles, which of course makes it a considerable choice for those who do not have the time and power to render out thousands of frames in a rather quick time frame. that is the objective fact, however I personally go for cycles, no matter how long it takes; mostly because 
  having such good lighting makes it worth it. denoising tools exist, and they absolutely get the job of cutting down time done. cycles is my go to.</p><br>
  <p style="line-height: 1.75">> i think it's best if you see what eevee can do first. here i have a(very cute!!) character that i'm planning to use for one of my upcoming projects. i've rendered her out in eevee. take a look, remember what you see!!</p>

  <p style="line-height: 1.75">> the transition from hair to skin is clear, shadows show subsurface scattering much better and have a red hue on skin(like in real life), the goggles have better looking lenses and everything is simply better to look at.</p>
   <p style="line-height: 1.75">> of course, this is all subjective; but cycles, in my opinion, is much more pleasant to the eye. on bigger scales, cycles is much more noticeable. the following examples will show this!!</p>
