  <p style="line-height: 1.75">> you read that right!! this post is gonna go into the plans and hopes i have for my brand new project!!</p><br>
  <p style="line-height: 1.75">> 
    i am still thinking of a name for this brand new project, i was thinking something similar to "Plane Crazy"
     like the Mickey Mouse short or something related to achieving greater than you would ever begin to imagine
     just by having fun doing the thing you love.

  <p style="line-height: 1.75">> 
    the story is about 2 kids, Aurélie and Aimé, living on a sky island. planes? what are those?! flying contraptions were unheard of here. however, they absolutely loved the idea of touching the clouds in the sky,
     and after seeing a bird in the sky, they decided to just go for it!! Aurélie always had fun making things
     out of things from the scrapyard, and even if she wasn't experienced at all, often just making silly little shoddy wooden figures of
     her brother, she was happy!! Aimé loves his sister, he's always worried about her. Aimé had a fascination for motors and hydrodynamics, as he would always go by the lake on a boat to fish for his family.
     he was ECSTATIC to help Aurélie. Aimé was more often than not just used as a test dummy for a bunch of failed attempts, though. justice for Aimé, lol,,
     the story builds from there!!
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 1.75">> 
    i am incredibly excited to make this story into its own film, and i'll be spending the rest of this summer working out the kinks and building out the
     world and animation.
